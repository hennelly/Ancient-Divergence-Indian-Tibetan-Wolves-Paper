This final dataset has the information on weights of each of 15 topologies, the starting position of the 100-SNP window, the mean recombination rate within
that 100-SNP window, and the chromosome numbers. 

The dataset is around 29MB and is too big to load on Github. It is located in my iCloud Drive/UC-Davis/Ph.D projects/Writing/Manuscript 1/FinalDatasets

The name is the dataset is: FINISHED_TOPO15_WHOLEGENOME_15topology_meanrecombinationrate_05282021.csv
