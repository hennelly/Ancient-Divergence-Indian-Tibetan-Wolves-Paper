# Code for the Genomics of Basal Wolf Lineages Project

This repository contains the code, some datasets and results for the manuscript "*Ancient divergence of Indian and Tibetan wolves revealed by low-recombination regions of the genome*."

The **Aligning_and_Filtering** folder contains scripts for the following categories: Trimming, alignment, calling SNPs using freebayes, additional filtering steps, and attaching the Y chromosome onto the Dog reference genome. 

The **Genomewide_Summary_Analysis** folder contains scripts and results for running Admixture, Principle Component Analysis, and inferring the pairwise Fst. 

The **GeneFlow_Analyses** folder contains the scripts and results for the D statistic, F3 statistic analyses, and qpGraph. 

The **Phylogenomics** folder contains the scripts and results for inferring the autosomal, mitogenome, and X chromosome phylogeny. 

The **TopologyweightAnalysis** folder contains the scripts and results for inferring Topology weights using Twisst and inferring the distributions of topology weights. 

The **Recombination_Analysis** folder contains scripts and results for inferring the recombination rates based from the Dog Genome and inferring the autosomal and X chromosome phylogeny from low recombination regions.
